This is the repository of the Python (3.7+) implementation of CASPAR (Cognitive Architecture System Planned and Reactive)
referred to the paper: [A Reactive Cognitive Architecture based on Natural Language Processing for the task of Decision-Making
using a Rich Semantic](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2706/), presented in WOA 2020: Workshop “From Objects to Agents”, September 14–16, 2020, Bologna, Italy.

# Testing
This cognitive architecture is designed to implement more intelligent agents and also 
is an agent itself. Before starting the agent, Entities and Speech-To-Text Interfaces must be defined.

### Entities definition

---------------

Entities involved in reasoning must be defined in the Smart Environment Interface 
(line 256 of caspar.py).

### Speech-To-Text Interfaces

---------------

SST Interfaces (for both hotwords and utterances) must be defined inside the Instances Sensors 
(lines 8 and 26 of sensors.py).
 

### Starting Phidias Shell

---------------

```sh
> python caspar.py

          PHIDIAS Release 1.3.4.alpha (deepcopy-->clone,micropython,py3)
          Autonomous and Robotic Systems Laboratory
          Department of Mathematics and Informatics
          University of Catania, Italy (santoro@dmi.unict.it)
          
eShell: main >
```
### Starting agent

---------------

```sh
eShell: main > go()
eShell: main > Starting Caspar...

Starting Hotword detection...

eShell: main >
```
Even without entities and Speech-To-Text interfaces definition, an agent's testing can be done as it follows by
simulating vocal events:

### Waking agent

---------------

Here we suppose the agent recognizes a proper waking word (_caspar_ for example) and exits from its idle state, by asserting the following belief:
```sh
eShell: main > assert HOTWORD_DETECTED("ON")
```
Or more shortly:
```sh
eShell: main > +HOTWORD_DETECTED("ON")
eShell: main > 

Yes, I'm here!

Stopping Hotword detection...

Starting utterance detection...
```

after ten seconds of inactivity:
```sh
Returning to idle state...

Stopping utterance detection...

Starting Hotword detection...
```
the amount of waiting seconds can be changed in the AGENT section of the config.ini file (WAIT_TIME).

### IoT commands and routines

---------------

By the means of two testing procedure IoT direct commands can be tested, whose entities are defined
 in the Smart Enviroment interface:
* set the cooler at 27 degrees in the bedroom

```sh
eShell: main > +STT("set the cooler at 27 degrees in the bedroom")

Stopping utterance detection...

Processing domotic command...

set the cooler at 27 degrees in the bedroom

Starting Hotword detection...

---- Result: execution successful

Action: specify.v.02
Object: cooler
Location: bedroom
Parameters: at 27 degree
```
* turn off the lights in the living room
```sh
eShell: main > +STT("turn off the lights in the living room")

Stopping utterance detection...

Processing domotic command...

turn off the lights in the living room

Starting Hotword detection...

---- Result: execution successful

Action: change_state.v.01
Object: light
Location: living room
Parameters: off
```
Caspar is capable of parsing complex routines as it follow (the agent must be first awakened):

* turn off the lights in the living room, when the temperature is 25 and the time is 12.00
```sh
eShell: main > +STT("turn off the lights in the living room, when the temperature is 25 and the time is 12.00")

Stopping utterance detection...

Processing domotic command...

turn off the lights in the living room, when the temperature is 25 and the time is 12.00

Starting Hotword detection...

eShell: main > 
```
Now routines related beliefs are stored into Beliefs Knowledge Base, which can be view with the command _kb_:
```sh
eShell: main > kb

COND('420548', 'be', 'temperature', '25')
COND('420548', 'be', 'time', '12.00')      
ROUTINE('420548', 'turn', 'light', 'living room', 'off')

eShell: main > 
```
The routine will wait for execution, until the two beliefs COND are satisfied. Let's simulate CONDs 
satisfaction by simulating two Sensor detections, which let the agent decide on routine execution.
 ```sh
eShell: main > +SENSOR('be','time','12.00')

asserting SENSOR('be','time','12.00')...

conditional triggered by a sensor...

Result: not all routine's conditionals are currently met!
```
The time-related COND is satisfied, but it isn't enough for routine execution because 
it miss another COND satisfaction:
```sh
eShell: main > kb

COND('420548', 'be', 'temperature', '25')
ROUTINE('420548', 'turn', 'light', 'living room', 'off')

eShell: main > 
```
as another Sensor detection meet the temperature-related COND as well, the routine can be executed:
```sh
eShell: main > +SENSOR('be','temperature','25')

asserting SENSOR('be','temperature','25')...

conditional triggered by a sensor...

executing routine...

---- Result: execution successful

Action: change_state.v.01
Object: light
Location: living room
Parameters: off
```
### Conceptual Reasoning

---------------

All the Caspar's expressive capabilities are summarized [here](examples.md).
In order to distinguish working contexts, conceptual reasoning will be triggered by two specific
hotwords (after the agent is awakened):
* _listen_: the agent will wait (until timeout) for utterances in natural language to be converted in definite clauses
and asserted in the Clauses Knowledge Base.
* _reason_: the agent will wait (until timeout) for one utterance in natural language to be converted in a
single positive literal for querying the Clauses Knowledge Base.

Next the Clauses Knowledge base will be fed by the following utterances:
* _Cuba is an hostile nation_
* _Colonel West is American_
* _missiles are weapons_
* _Colonel West sells missiles to Cuba_
* _When an American sells weapons to a hostile nation, that American is a criminal_

and queried by:
* _Colonel West is a criminal?_

We will show (by the command s()) the Clauses Knowlegde Base content after every assertion simulation:
* _Nono is an hostile nation_
```sh
eShell: main > +STT("listen")
eShell: main > 
Waiting for knowledge...

eShell: main > +STT("Nono is an hostile nation")
Got it.

now it is time to query the Clauses Knowledge Base with the following utterance:
* _Colonel West is a criminal?_

```sh

Waiting for query...

eShell: main > +STT("Colonel West is a criminal")
Got it.

Reasoning...............

Query: Be(Colonel_West(x1), Criminal(x2))

 ---- NOMINAL REASONING ---

Result: False


 ---- NESTED REASONING ---

Result:  {v_219: v_129, v_220: x2, v_280: v_216, v_281: v_217, v_282: v_218, v_366: v_277, v_367: v_278, v_368: v_279}
```
Above are showed both results of Nominal Reasoning by the Backward-Chaining argorithm and Nested Reasoning.
